Experimenting with Trimodal Learning for Stock Price Prediction

Multimodal learning is a technique that integrates data and signals in multiple modes to learn from. In this project I use data on AAPL stocks in three different modes -- time series, text, and tabular -- and use them to predict future prices. These three modes are represented by historical prices, news headlines and tweets about Apple and the AAPL stock, and Apple's financial statement.

The aim is to formulate an efficient and effective technique to utilise the data available on stocks in many different modes, and train an LSTM model that can predict how the stock is going to perform in the near future.
